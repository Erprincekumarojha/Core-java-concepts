
Java :
         1.Java is very simple,high-level,secured ,multithreaded,platform independent,object orented programming
		    language, it was developed by james Gosling in sun-Microsystem in 1990's for developing 
			Internet Application.
         2.The first version is released in janwary 23, 1996.
		 3.It is descendent of c/c++ programming language. it syntex is similar to the c and c++ language.
		 4.so, in java we cannot see the most horrible topic such as pointers,structure,union,operator overloading,
		    multiple inheritance and many more.


 Java Features:
                      1.Simple                         2.Object oriented
					  3.secure							4.Multithread
					  5.Rubost							6.High performance
					  7.Portable						8.Distributed
					  9.Architecture neutral      10.Dynamic


  What is the abbrevation of java:
                       
					     1.There is no Abbrevation in java.
						 2.it means that what is the fullform of java
						 3. there is no any full form of java language.

Class :
           1.A class is a user define data type.
           2.A class--the basic building block of an object-oriented language such as Java--is a
		        template and  blue print that describes the data and behavior associated with instances of that class.
           3.When you instantiate a class you create an object that looks and feels like other instances
		        of the same class.
           4.A class is combination of Data members and member function
 
                 For Example:-Bike,Car,Dog,BankAccount,Student,College. its a only RWO name.

Object :
            1.Object is a Real world things,entity which can see,watch and using is called object .
			2.Any real-world living and non-living thing is called object
			3.The instance of a class is nothing but object.
			4.Object having a property and behaviers to store in the class.
                  
				   For example:-Bike(Bike number,color,model). its having only property is called the object

Instance :
              1.An instance is a single, unique memory allocation of a class that represents that object 
			     physically with specific values.
               
			         For example:- Bike(123,"pulser 180", "Red") . its having a actual values is called Instance.

Variable	:
             1.Variable is a named memory location used to store data temporarily. During programm execution
			     we can modify that data.
			 2.A variable can be create by using Datatype. As we have two types of datatypes .
			 3. We can create two types of variable.

                                  1).Primitive variable. ex-int,char,boolean,short,float,long,byte,double.
								  2).Referenced variable. ex-Array,String, UserDefine class 
								 

Method:
            1.Method is a sub block of class that is used for implementing logic of an object's operation.

    Rule:-Logic must be placed only inside a method, not directily at class level. if you placed logic class level
                   compiler through error.
            2.So, at class level we are allow to place only variable and method creation statements.
			3.The logical statement such as method calls,variable ,calculation, and data printing related statement
			    must be placed in side a method, becouse these statement are considered as logic.
           
                                                             OOP Concepts
=================================================================================
                      1.Encapsulation
					  2.Inheritance
					  3.polymorphism
					   
Encapsulation :
                   1.The process of creating a class by binding variables and method as one unit
				       and than operating  variable only through these methods is called encapsulation.
				   2.By developing encapsulation we are hiding data from direct access from another class, methods and 
				       providing it's access only through publicly accessible setter and getter methods  with proper validation
					   is called encapsulation.



How can we develop encapsulation in java ?
    :-In java ,we developed encapsulation
	  1. By declearing all variables as private.
	  2. By defining one pair of public setter and getter method.

Inheritance:
                  1.The process of creating new object by obtaining type,properties & behaviours of an existing object is called
				      inheritance.
                  2. Through inheritance we can reuse the existing object properties and behaviors with our new object reference
				       as if  they were defining in our object class.
				  3. It is the one of the most important features of object oriented programming. it is the concept that is used 
				      for reusability and changeability purpose.
				
Advantage of inheritance:
                  Through inheritance we can we will  get_mainly two benifits thay are:
				  1.Reusability.
				  2.Runtime polymorphism(or dynamic binding).
             

How inheritance can be implemented in java:
                Inheritance can be implemented in java using below two keywords.
				  1.extends:- "is used for developing inheritance between two classes or two interfaces."
				  2.implements:-"is used for developing inheritance between interface ,class."
				
					
When should we develop inheritance:
                 1.When we find new object with the same properties and behaviours of an existing class ,we can must develop
				     inheritance between these two objects. So that new object will be treated as an existing object type.
                  
UP CASTING :
                   1.Storing sub class object ref variable in super Class Reference variable is called UpCasting.
				   2.

				     
                  Ex- Person p=new Student(); 
                
      Need:-To achive dynamic binding b/w sub class to super class
      
            
     
DOWN CASTING:
						1.Reading sub class object reference from super class ref varaible and converting it's type 
						    from super class type to it's on type by using cast operator is called Down Casting.
						
                            
                      Ex- Student s=(student);     

                      
      Need: To achiving /retriving sub class object access than down casting.
     
Used of super keyword:
       
	         1.The super is a java keyword which is used to access super class variables, methods and constructers
			     from sub class members. it has two syntaxes are
			       A. super();
				   B. super;
			  
-->super() is used to call the super class constructers from sub class constructers only. 

-->super is used to call super class variables and methods from subclass members.



Used of this keyword:
   
               1.It is a keyword used to store current object reference.
